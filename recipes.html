Scones

<div class="recipes">
INGREDIENTS
</div>
  2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, (320g)

  1/4 tsp salt

  3 1/2 tsp baking powder

  3/4 stick cold butter, (85g)

  3 tbsp granulated sugar

  3/4 cup milk, (175ml)

  1 tsp lemon juice

  1 tsp vanilla extract

  1 egg, beaten

<div class="recipes">
INSTRUCTIONS
</div>
  Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).

  In a large bowl mix flour with the salt, baking powder, and sugar. Add the butter, then rub it in with your fingers until the mixture looks like fine crumbs.

  Heat up the milk on the stove until warm, but not hot. Add the vanilla and lemon juice, then set aside for a moment. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat and put it in the oven.

  Add the milk mixture to the dry mixture and combine them quickly with a fork.

  Scatter some flour on the work surface and tip the dough out. Dredge the dough and your hands with a little more flour, then fold the dough over 2-3 times until it’s a little smoother. Don't overwork the dough. Pat into a round about 1.5-inch (4cm) high.

  Use a 2 1/2 inch round cookie cutter and plunge into the dough, repeat until all the dough is used. You should get 8 scones.

  Brush the tops with egg wash, then carefully place onto the hot baking tray.

  Bake for 10-15 mins until risen and golden on the top. Eat just warm or cold on the day of baking generously topped with jam and clotted cream.

<h3>Shortbread Cookies</h3>
</div>
<div class="recipes">
INGREDIENTS
</div>
  1 cup all-purpose flour

  ¼ cup confectioners’ sugar

  ¼ cup sugar

  ½ teaspoon salt

  ½ cup butter, room temperature

  ¾ teaspoon vanilla extract

  2 tablespoons turbinado sugar
</div>
<div class="recipes">
INSTRUCTIONS
</div>
<div class="recipes">

  In the work bowl of a food processor, combine flour, confectioners’ sugar, sugar, and salt, pulsing to blend. Add butter and vanilla, pulsing until dough comes together in a ball. Divide dough into 2 equal portions. Using your hands, shape dough portions into 10-inch-long ropes. Set aside.

  Place 2 (12-x-2-inch) sheets plastic wrap on work surface. Sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon turbinado sugar.

  Place a dough rope on each prepared sheet, and roll in sugar to coat. Wrap each dough portion in plastic wrap, twisting ends to seal. Refrigerate until dough is very hard, 6 to 8 hours.

  Preheat oven to 325°.

  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.

  Cut cold dough into ¼-inch slices, and place on the prepared baking sheets.

  Bake until cookie edges are light golden brown, 12 to 13 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
