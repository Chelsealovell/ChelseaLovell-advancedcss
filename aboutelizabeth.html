  <p>
  As an avid traveler and self-proclaimed foodie, I am fascinated by the lifestyle industry.  I enjoy creating unique and fun experiences for those around me and have developed a great appreciation for the blend of artistry and strategy required to successfully achieve results.  The opportunity to cultivate relationships and work on creative endeavors has led me to pursue a career in public relations.  Throughout my time at the University of Miami, and in my diverse range of work assignments, Iâ€˜ve learned to ideate, collaborate, manage, and produce in various capacities.  Previous employers have cited my adaptability and positive energy as key components of my success.  I thrive in fast-paced and dynamic environments and am eager to learn new skills.

  I look forward to my next opportunity to both learn and provide high quality work.  Please reach me at evpozz@gmail.com for more information
